## Hello :steam_locomotive:

For my hobby (modelrailroad and electronics) , I developed some hard- and software, most for the usage on model-railroad.<br>
I also provide some informations about the large and small railroad, to be found under [Infoletter](https://github.com/Kruemelbahn/Infoletter).<br>
Enjoy!<br>
