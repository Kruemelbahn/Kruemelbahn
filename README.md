## Hello :steam_locomotive:

For my hobby (modelrailroad and electronics) , I developed some hard- and software, most for the usage on model-railroad.<br>
I also provide some informations about the large and small railroad, to be found under [Infoletter](https://github.com/Kruemelbahn/Infoletter).<br>
Enjoy!<br>
<br>
### Used Developmenttools
for Hardware: [Target3001!](https://www.ibfriedrich.com/) and [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/)<br>
for Software: [Microsoft Visualstudio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/), [Arduino-IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Atmel-Studio 7.0](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/DEV/ProductDocuments/SoftwareTools/as-installer-7.0.2594-full.exe) and [MPLAB-IDE 8.92](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/archives/mplab-ecosystem)<br> 
> [!NOTE]
> using [MPLAB X IDE v6.25](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) instead of Atmel-Studio 7.0 requests an additional compiler for some of my projects:<br>
> - [AVR-GCC](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio/gcc-compilers)
> - documentation how to download and install [AVRASM2](https://nicerland.com/eduFiles/AVR/Tutorials/MPLab_asm.pdf)
>
> It is recommended that you always use the latest version of hard- and software (especially the Developmenttools).<br>
